## 👋 Introducing Hungry-Hero

The `Hungry Hero` is a modern web application that lets you check out restaurants, see how good they are, look at pictures of delicious food, and find specific types of cuisine. It's easy to use, with a nice design, helping you discover where to eat

Yes, it's an `open-source` web app!

Is that all? Nope. You can also create your feature and share them with the world. The best part is that the ReactJS developer will `review` your project code before it gets part of the `Hungry-Hero` app.

### Note: CORS Extension Required 🚨

Before running this application, make sure to install the CORS extension for Google Chrome. This extension is essential for proper functionality during development.

### Why do you need this extension?

Our application uses client-side rendering and fetches data from the Swiggy API. However, Swiggy's API may restrict access from the browser due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies. To bypass this restriction during development, we require you to install the CORS extension.

Rest assured, we are actively working on making the app run smoothly without the need for any extensions. We plan to launch this improved version soon.

#### To install the CORS extension, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [CORS Extension on Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf).

2. Click on the "Add to Chrome" button to install the extension.

3. Once installed, you should be all set to use our application without any issues.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation! If you have any questions or encounter any problems, please let us know.

### All the best 🙌🏼
