## 👋 Introducing Hungry-Hero

The `Hungry Hero` is a modern web application that lets you check out restaurants, see how good they are, look at pictures of delicious food, and find specific types of cuisine. It's easy to use, with a nice design, helping you discover where to eat

Yes, it's an `open-source` web app!

Is that all? Nope. You can also create your feature and share them with the world. The best part is that the ReactJS developer will `review` your project code before it gets part of the `Hungry-Hero` app.

## Quick start :

```
$ npm install or yarn install
$ npm start or yarn run
```
